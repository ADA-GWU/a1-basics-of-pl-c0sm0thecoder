The Python version for slicing is pretty simple. You are asked to enter the size of the grid and where you want to slice it.

Doing it in C is a bit different. The inputs are still the same, but the slicing is done manually, manage the memory allocation, and loop through to copy the slice piece by piece. I used an external library called libpng to show the output as a png. The images are saved as `original.png` and `sliced.png`.

## GPT Generation

I achieved writing this program with ChatGPT using single prompt: "Write a Python script that creates a 2D numpy matrix based on a user-specified dimension. It should then ask the user for slice coordinates (start/end for rows and columns) and extract that slice. Finally, display both the original and the sliced matrix as grayscale images in one window using matplotlib."

The code returned is available in /code/gpt_generated/slicer.py
